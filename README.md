This project tries to recreate the iOS calculator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Going over the requirements:

    -The calculator should function like a normal calculator and styled to design of the iOS calculator app.

    -C means clear. When a user clicks it, it should clear everything and go back to the first state it was in when the page loaded.

    -Doing the back arrow is like pressing backspace; it'll delete the last character typed. If it's clicked when there's only one digit, 
    it sets the current  number to be 0.

    -Calculators tend to have some special behavior when you hit equals: if you type another number it erases the results and starts over. 
    Here, it is treated normally and makes the user hit C if they want to clear it.
